## My process
- I rearranged the HTML file given in the challenges
- I created a CSS file to design the web page and linked it to the HTML file
- In the CSS file, I displayed the main div with CSS grid and styled each side to satisfaction

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to style table rows. I had never tried styling a table row before but with this challenge I learnt how to use tr td:first-child {} and tr td:last-child{} to style respective table rows.

### Continued development

I want to work more on projects that have to do with animations next time because I am not really confident about it.
